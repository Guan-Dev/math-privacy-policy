<h2>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h2>
<h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>
<h4>Personal Data</h4>
<p>Our Service is designed for and directed to children. Therefore, **we do not ask You to provide Us with any personally identifiable information (PII)** that can be used to contact or identify You, especially for users under the age of 13. We are committed to protecting children's privacy and comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable laws.</p>
<h4>Usage Data</h4>
<p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service. For all users, especially children, this data is collected in an **anonymous and aggregated form**. It is used solely to improve our Service, such as understanding app performance, identifying usage trends (e.g., popular features, crash reports), and evaluating the effectiveness of our non-personal advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Usage Data may include information such as Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that You visit, the time and date of Your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data. **However, for child users, we specifically configure our Service and any third-party providers (like advertising networks) to prevent the collection of persistent identifiers that can be used to identify or track an individual over time or across different services.** This means we do not use device IDs or IP addresses for behavioral targeting or to create user profiles for children. All collected usage data from children is anonymized or aggregated.</p>
<p>When You access the Service by or through a mobile device, We may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device You use, Your mobile device unique ID, the IP address of Your mobile device, Your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser You use, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data. **For children, this data is strictly for operational purposes (e.g., ensuring compatibility, delivering contextual ads) and is not linked to any personal information or used for tracking purposes.**</p>
<p>We may also collect information that Your browser sends whenever You visit our Service or when You access the Service by or through a mobile device.</p>
<h3>Use of Your Personal Data</h3>
<p>The Company may use **anonymous and aggregated data** for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>To provide and maintain our Service</strong>, including to monitor the usage of our Service in an aggregated, non-identifiable manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For business transfers:</strong> We may use Your information to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which **non-personal, aggregated data** held by Us about our Service users is among the assets transferred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For other purposes</strong>: We may use Your information for other purposes, such as anonymous data analysis, identifying general usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, and to evaluate and improve our Service, products, services, marketing, and user experience. **No personal data from children is used for these purposes.**</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We **do not use Personal Data** for purposes like managing accounts, performing contracts, contacting you directly (unless for critical security updates where parental consent would be sought if required), or providing news/offers, as our Service is designed for children and does not collect such information from them. </p>
<p>We may share Your **anonymous or aggregated information** in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share **anonymous and aggregated usage information** with Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service, and for the delivery of **contextual, non-personalized advertising**.</li>
<li><strong>For business transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer Your **anonymous or aggregated information** in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of Our business to another company.</li>
<li><strong>With Affiliates:</strong> We may share Your **anonymous or aggregated information** with Our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include Our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that We control or that are under common control with Us.</li>
<li><strong>With business partners:</strong> We may share Your **anonymous or aggregated information** with Our business partners to deliver **contextual, non-personalized ads**.</li>
<li><strong>With other users:</strong> Our Service **does not include public interaction areas** where personal information can be shared.</li>
<li><strong>With Your consent</strong>: In the rare event that we need to share any specific information beyond anonymous data, we would only do so with explicit and verifiable parental consent, as required by law.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Third-Party Advertising in Children's Apps</h3>
<p>Our application includes **non-personalized advertising** provided by Google AdMob. We are committed to showing only ads that are suitable for children and that comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other relevant privacy laws.</p>
<p>Here's how we ensure compliance for advertising in our app:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We have explicitly configured our Google AdMob SDK to treat all ad requests as **child-directed content** by setting `tagForChildDirectedTreatment: ChildDirectedTreatment.yes`. This prevents the serving of interest-based ads (personalized ads) and remarketing.</li>
    <li>We have set the maximum ad content rating to **'G' (General audiences)** by setting `maxAdContentRating: MaxAdContentRating.g`. This ensures that only ads suitable for all ages, including families and children, are displayed.</li>
    <li>**No personal data, persistent identifiers, or device information that could be used to track individual children over time or across different services is collected or used for advertising purposes.** All advertising is contextual, meaning it is based on the content of the app itself, not on the user's behavior or personal information.</li>
    <li>Google AdMob's privacy policies for child-directed apps can be found at: 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6223431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Publisher Policies for Families (AdMob)</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6219315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tagging Your Ad Requests for Child-Directed Treatment (AdMob)</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Retention of Your Data</h3>
<p>The Company will retain **anonymous and aggregated Usage Data** only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use this data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain aggregated data for audit purposes), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. No personal data from children is retained.</p>
<p>The Company will also retain **anonymous and aggregated Usage Data** for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of Our Service (in an aggregated, non-identifiable way), or We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Your Data</h3>
<p>Your **anonymous and aggregated information** is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such **anonymous or aggregated information** represents Your agreement to that transfer.</p>
<p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your **anonymous and aggregated data** is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of any personal data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.</p>
<h3>Delete Your Data</h3>
<p>Since our Service does not collect any personal identifiable information from children, there is no personal data to delete for individual users. All usage data collected is anonymous and aggregated. If You have any concerns about data collection or wish to enquire about our data practices, please contact us.</p>
<p>Our Service **does not provide account functionality** or the ability to update, amend, or delete personal information from within the Service, as we do not collect personal information from children.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain **anonymous and aggregated information** when we have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so.</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Your Data</h3>
<h4>Business Transactions</h4>
<p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your **anonymous or aggregated data** may be transferred. We will provide notice before such data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>Law enforcement</h4>
<p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose **anonymous or aggregated Usage Data** if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>
<h4>Other legal requirements</h4>
<p>The Company may disclose **anonymous or aggregated data** in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
<li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
<li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
<li>Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public</li>
<li>Protect against legal liability</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security of Your Data</h3>
<p>The security of Your **anonymous and aggregated data** is important to Us. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect this data, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We implement reasonable security measures appropriate to the nature of the non-personal data we collect.</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our Service, **Mental Arithmetic, is designed for children and intended for use by users of all ages, including those under 13.** We are committed to protecting the privacy of children and fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable privacy laws concerning children's online data.</p>
<p>Consistent with these laws, **we do not knowingly collect, store, or solicit any personal identifiable information (PII) from children.** This includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, precise geolocation information, or unique persistent identifiers that can be used to identify or track a child over time or across different services.</p>
<p>Any data collected, such as usage data, is **strictly anonymous and aggregated**. This data is used solely for internal operations (e.g., to improve app performance, identify general usage trends, deliver contextual ads) and cannot be used to identify or track an individual child. For example, while we collect IP addresses for operational purposes, they are not stored in a way that links to individual children or used for tracking.</p>
<p>If a parent or guardian believes that we have inadvertently collected personal information from their child without verifiable parental consent, please contact us immediately at **[tyleesemike@gmail.com]**. We will promptly take steps to investigate and remove such information from our servers.</p>
<p>Our app **does not allow children to disclose personal information publicly** or interact freely with other users in public forums.</p>
<p>We use **non-personalized advertising** from Google AdMob, which is configured to comply with COPPA and Google's policies for child-directed apps. This means ads are contextual, not based on user behavior, and do not involve tracking or profiling of children. Please refer to the "Third-Party Advertising in Children's Apps" section above for more details.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
<p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>
<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services. **We especially caution parents and guardians to review the privacy practices of any third-party links or content accessed through our app, as their policies may differ.**</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
<p>We will let You know via email and/or a prominent notice on Our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
